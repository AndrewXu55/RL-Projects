# Personal Reinforcement Learning Projects
By: Andrew Xu

This repository contains several personal reinforcement learning projects. You will find in-depth descriptions of each project below:

## Cartpole Project

This project was based on the **OpenAIGym Cartpole Problem**. It is detailed [here](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/). The main idea is to keep a pole up and standing on a cart by only moving the cart left and right.

This project involved 
- Reinforcement Learning
- Deep Q-Learning
- TensorFlow and Keras
- Softmax Action Selection
- Visualization with OpenCV and Matplotlib
- Multi-threading for Asynchronous Operations
