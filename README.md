This repository contains several personal reinforcement learning projects. You will find in-depth descriptions of each project below:

## Cartpole Project

This project was based on the **OpenAIGym Cartpole Problem**. It is detailed [here](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/). The main idea is to keep a pole up and standing on a cart by only moving the cart left and right.
